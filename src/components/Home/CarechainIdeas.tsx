                            Developing from a Learning Framework
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            A learning framework developed by founder Abu Sayeed
                            called Carechain Of Internally and Externally
                            Influenced Learning
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Developed from a few multilayers of frameworks that
                            exist in the human context. Also, new frameworks can
                            be created and implemented by DAO society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Learning is restricted to a project for better
                            clarity where projects have a team, funding, etc.
                            Basically, learning is a secondary action; working
                            on anything is a primary action. To learn when you
                            need to or are stuck.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the idea that management is more important than
                            learning, it provides another framework where all
                            our actions fall in an activity management
                            framework.
